# Digital Image Correlation
We are looking for a displacement **D** between the **reference** image *f(x,y)* and **target** image *g(x',y')* of the form

.center[![D(x,y)](./displacement.png)]

in which

.center[![xyprime](./xyprime.png)]

such that a certain **correlation criteria** C is optimal, i.e. a global minimum (or maximum).

In literature, two criteria are used: ZNSSD and ZNCC. 

---

# Digital Image Correlation
## Correlation criteria

Let *f(x,y)* be *f<sub>ij</sub>* and *g(x',y')* be *g<sub>ij</sub>*, and let the summation be over the complete subset. Then SSD and CC are defined as:

SSD - Sum of Squared Differences

.center[![SSD](./ssd.png)]

CC - Cross Correlation

.center[![CC)](./CC.png)]

---

# Digital Image Correlation
## Correlation criteria

Let *f<sub>m</sub>* and *g<sub>m</sub>* be the mean value of the reference and target subset. Then

.center[![ZSSD](./zssd.png)]

takes brightness offset between the images into account.

Let *<span style="text-decoration: overline;">f</span><sub>ij</sub>* be *f<sub>ij</sub> - f<sub>m</sub>* and *<span style="text-decoration: overline;">g</span><sub>ij</sub>* be *g<sub>ij</sub> - g<sub>m</sub>*, then normalization results in

.center[![ZNSSD](./znssd.png)]

so that scale changes in the intensity is taken into account as well.

So.. which one do we use? It can be proven algebraically that

.center[![ZNCC vs ZNSSD](./comparison.png)]

so there is no real advantage for one over the other. ZNSSD is easier to compute, so let's use that.
