### ./src/correlation/priorityqueue/mkgroup/dic/DicResult.java
A wrapper for a DicResult. Very simple. It has the following fields:

* (double) coefficient
* (int) row  (the row **position** of the gridpoint in the gridpoints array)
* (int) col  (the column **position** of the gridpoint in the gridpoints array)

For more information regarding the compilation of this java code, see README.md.
### ./src/correlation/priorityqueue/mkgroup/dic/DicResultComparator.java
A comparator for DicResult classes so it can be used in a Java PriorityQueue. Lower coefficients come first.
